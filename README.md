# Welcome to Unbiasify
Unbiasify is a tool to help reduce the amount of unconscious bias that people face when perusing many aspects of the internet.

The current functionality includes the ability to obfuscate/remove names and avatars from linkedin.

If you'd just like access to the tool, you can install it over at the chrome store 
<!-- TODO: Add a link -->

# How to use

After you have installed the extension you should be able to see a little unbiasify in your extensions list beside your address bar

Next; all you have to do is go to linked in and click that icon. Depending on what option you select in the dropdown all user names and/or images will be obsured, leaving you free to focus on what really matters; people's skills and experiences.

`Ctrl+Shift+;` on Windows and `Cmd+Shift+;` on Mac work as master toggles and toggle names and images on all supported sites.

Using the file explorer, locate and open the unbiasify directory wherever you cloned/unzipped it to.
