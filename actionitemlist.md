LINKEDIN IMPROVEMENTS
-notice that chrome doesn't remember the setting from when I last used Unbiasify. i.e. if I close chrome and open chrome again, I have to re-toggle.
-https://www.linkedin.com/messaging is buggy, some names show, others don't


SITES TO ADD TO UNBIASIFY
-Angelist
-Facebook
-Twitter
-Github
-Meetup.com



NICE TO HAVES
-Master toggle switch turn all names and/or all photos off
-Other sourcing tools
-Diversity and Inclusion links, resources
-D and I newsfeed?
